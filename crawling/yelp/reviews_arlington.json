I might not be able to afford or convince my parents to pay for an overpriced $2,000/month apartment upstairs, but I'll certainly wait 30min for some delicious Korean fried chicken. I've ordered from the Fairfax location, and this Arlington location is just as good, if not better. I do take out only. My only advice is to not over eat this chicken. It's got a lot of oil and you will have massive diarrhea and digestive problems. Make sure to eat some rice and radishes with it. No 5 stars because a lot of the meat tends to shrink and all you're left with is the breading.", "url": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/bonchon-arlington-arlington?start=360", "restaurant_name": ["Bonchon Arlington - Arlington, VA"]},

I will never eat here again. If you look up their restaurant on google, you can see all of the violations the health department has given them. I have never had diarrhea like this and will have to go to the doctor and utilize my health insurance due to their contaminated environment. DONT eat here if you dont want to get sick! The place is dirty. Look at it once you walk in!", "url": "http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-pollo-rico-arlington?start=1040", "restaurant_name": ["El Pollo Rico - Virginia Square - Arlington, VA"]}]
